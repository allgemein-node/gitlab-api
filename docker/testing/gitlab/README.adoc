## Testing the Api with Gitlab-EE docker container

Start the container with:
```
docker-compose up
```

At startup the script "startup.sh" will be execute which proceeds with
the installation of gitlab-ee till it is finished. Then the backup file
(under backups/test) with
test groups, projects, users, issues, etc. will be installed.


Users:

* username: root +
  password: gitlab12345 +
  token: _1xqBqP8Qt7M1xwMAr-u

* username: test +
  password: test1234 +
  token: Nx78xRzzLMKxBVmYnhzr +

Projects:

* name: personal-project +
  owner: test +
  token: pp8WreXi_mBsLUC6vmKh


New changes needed for testing should be configured in the web ui of the gitlab instance.
After made changes the instance must be backuped and replacing backups/test file.

```
$ docker exec -it gitlab_ee_cont /bin/bash
docker$ gitlab-backup create
docker$ cp /var/opt/gitlab/backups/123456_gitlab_backup.tar /var/opt/gitlab/backups/test_gitlab_backup.tar
docker$ exit
```
